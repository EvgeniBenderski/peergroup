3,"Description of the Problem by the Owner","The owner describes what problem/success or difficult situation he has been facing recently. The problem is described from a professional standpoint. The problem should not be a personal life issue and the problem should not be between different members of the group.",5
4,"Questions about the Problem","All group members are now invited to check if they understood the problem right, the questions need to be specific to the point. The questions should not try to make suggestions already. The point is just to clarify the Problem of the Problem owner.",5
5,"Collecting Ideas","Now ideas are collected among the group members. They make suggestions but can also just state that they faced a similar problem, it might be a problem where there is no solution, making clear that going through certain problems in your professional life is normal, can also be a helpful insight for the problem owner. During this step the problem owner remains silent. He might take notes and try at best to wage the ideas in his mind, without being hesitant to totally embrace them fully at first and then picking the ones that apply to him best.",10
6,"Feeback on the Ideas","The problem owner has heard the ideas of the group now. He picks the ideas he thought best fit, the ones he disliked and gives statement on which ones he would like to move forward on and embrace them.",5

11,"Open Feedback","Every group member is asked to give feedback on the outcome of this single peer group supervision session. Did the roles leader and problem owner fill their roles as expected? Postive and Negative remarks should be placed here. However the feedback should not make the problem discussion back alive.",5
