== Welcome to Peer Group Supervision

Peer Group Supervision enables professionals to help each other.

== Updates

This is the first version, heavy alpha.

== Running the application

0. Fetch all submodules unsed by node server

  git submodule update --init

1. Install required gems into vendor/ruby/ subdirectory (for easier maintain)

  bundle install --path vendor/

2. Run redis (download from http://redis.io/download) - tested on 2.0 and 2.2 stable releases, optionally tweak config/redis.yml

3. Run node server (download from http://nodejs.org/#download) - tested on v0.4.2

  node app/node.js/server.js

You can run node as root user (sudo node ...) or with `authbind` (authbind node ...), so socket.io could bind for low port to serve xml policy file for Flash.

4. Run the application

  bundle exec rails server

5. Open http://localhost:3000

== Running tests

1. Install required gems into vendor/ruby/ subdirectory (for easier maintain)

  bundle install --path vendor/

2. Run Redis server instance

  redis-server config/redis-test.conf

3. Run tests:

  rake spec

=== BIG WARNING:

As with test database, make sure that you run your tests on separate Redis database, as this will flush you data before tests.

Unfortunately Redis gem uses default url for connection (redis://localhost:6379), so if you don't provide proper config (or use older gem than from master repository for Redis in case of unix socket), then instead of connecting to test database, your test environment could connect to other database and flush it all.

You have been warned!

== Translations

  Currently, the application is available in 2 languages: English and German. The locale is set during the application boot and it is not possible to switch it during application run.

  To change the locale edit aprropriate line in the environment file config/environments/production.rb or config/environments/development.rb. The line looks like:

  # I18n.default_locale = :en

=== Translations maintenance

  All translated strings are gathered automatically in the "test" and "cucumber" environments. They are saved to the config/locales/application_en.yml file. You can edit this file manually as the new translations will be merged so your old changes will not be lost.

  Other localized files are:
   * db/default_rules_<locale>.csv
   * app/views/pages/_about.<locale>.html.haml
   * app/views/pages/_help.<locale>.html.haml
   * README / LIESMICH
